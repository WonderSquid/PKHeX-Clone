Description: simple tool to work around common problems in Wine
 Winetricks lets you install missing DLLs or tweak various Wine settings
 individually.  It also has a menu of supported games/apps for which it
 can do all the workarounds automatically.
 .
 It can be used via GUI or commandline, whichever you prefer; the
 commandline mode is particularly useful as a building block in fancier
 wine frontends and in automated regression testing.
