23/01/26 - New Update: (33425) [6216411]
 - Changed: PKHeX now uses .NET 7 for its runtime (updated from .NET Framework 4.6)!
 - - Requires Windows 64bit operating system, with the .NET Desktop Runtime 7.0.x
 - - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
 - - For those wanting to run the program from a Mac/Linux machine, use a Windows VM. No more mono/wine support.
 - - This change results in a faster program, and being able to write more modern & extensible C# code.
 - Changed: The Main Window layout has been adjusted for better GUI scaling support:
 - - PKM Editor now uses vertical tabs, and some controls have moved to more appropriate tabs.
 - - PKM Editor now has a "Cosmetic" tab, which contains low significance values like Contest Stats.
 - - PKM Editor now has a simple selector for Handling Trainer selection rather than the background highlights.
 - Legality:
 - - Fixed: A few recognition bugs have been fixed. Thanks @Lorenzooone!
 - Batch Editor:
 - - Added: Batch Editor can now filter with >/≥ and </≤ operators, improved from just != and =.
 - - Added: Ribbon and Mark count properties added. Can now sort boxes by these counts!
 - - Changed: TID/SID properties renamed; when using 16-bit trainer IDs, use TID16/SID16.
 - Changed: Gen9 S/V no longer show the Square Shiny icon, as Xor0 no longer indicates differently in-game.
 - Changed: Gen9 S/V raid parameter editor "Set All 6 Star" changed to "Copy current values to Other Raids".
 - Changed: With the update to .NET 7, some features have been rewritten for better performance, or for better usage.
 - Changed: GUI translations updated. Thanks @Manu098vm, @Kitcham, @easyworld, @jimmyorz, @Bl4ckSh4rk, @ppllouf, @butaneeeee!
